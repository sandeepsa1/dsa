This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms learnings codes.
Each folder within the repository are different algorithm implementations and its variations. Each folder also contains a README.md file explaining details of each code snippets.
Also note that entire dsa folder is kept as a single virtual environment.
Run scripts\activate to activate the virtual environment from dsa folder to run the code.

List of code folders below:
01-dfs						DFS algoritms and its different uses and variations. Traversal, path finding, topological sort and spanning tree
02-bfs						BFS algoritms and its different uses and variations. Traversal and shortest path finding
03-dijkstras_algorithm      Dijkstra's algorithm code to find shortest path of a directed graph
