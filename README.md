# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains code snippets and implementations of various algorithms across different topics.

#### Virtual Environment
The entire `dsa` folder is organized as a single virtual environment. You can either download the entire folder and run any code after activating the virtual environment using using command `scripts\activate`. Or download any sub folders and run it. In this case you may have to import some libraries.

## Graph Theory

### 1. dfs
This section contains DFS algorithms and their various uses and variations, including traversal, path finding, topological sort, and spanning trees.

### 2. bfs
Here, you'll find BFS algorithms and their different applications, including traversal and shortest path finding.

### 3. dijkstras_algorithm
This folder contains code for Dijkstra's algorithm, used to find the shortest path in a directed graph
