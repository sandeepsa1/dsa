# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains code snippets and implementations of various algorithms across different topics.

#### Virtual Environment
The entire `dsa` folder is organized as a single virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the `dsa` folder and run `scripts\activate`.

## Table of Contents

## Graph Theory

#### 01-dfs
This section contains DFS algorithms and their various uses and variations, including traversal, path finding, topological sort, and spanning trees.

#### 02-bfs
Here, you'll find BFS algorithms and their different applications, including traversal and shortest path finding.

#### 03-dijkstras_algorithm
This folder contains code for Dijkstra's algorithm, used to find the shortest path in a directed graph
