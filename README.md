# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains code snippets and implementations of various algorithms across different topics.

#### Virtual Environment
The entire `dsa` folder is organized as a single virtual environment. You can either download the entire folder and run any code after activating the virtual environment using using command `scripts\activate`. Or download any sub folders and run it. In this case you may have to import some libraries.
