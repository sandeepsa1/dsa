### 1. Number of Islands
The problem of counting the number of islands in a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water) can be solved using graph traversal techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each island is a group of connected '1's (vertically or horizontally connected).

1. Time complexity: <b>ùëÇ(n * m)</b>
2. Space complexity: <b>ùëÇ(n * m)</b>

#### Steps
1. Traverse the grid, cell by cell.
2. When you find a '1', it means you have encountered an unvisited part of an island.
3. Use DFS to mark all the connected '1's as visited by changing them to '0' or using a separate visited array.
4. Increment the island count and continue searching for more unvisited '1's.
5. Repeat until the entire grid is traversed.

### 2. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
The "Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix" problem can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS), as BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

#### Steps
1. Use BFS to explore the shortest path level by level, starting from the top-left corner (0, 0).
2. Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
3. For each cell, check its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals).
4. If you reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1), return the current path length.
5. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the bottom-right, return -1 (no valid path exists).

### 3. Longest Path in a Matrix
The problem of finding the Longest Path in a Matrix involves determining the maximum length of a path such that the values in the matrix strictly increase along the path.

#### Steps
1. DFS with Memoization:
    - For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, perform DFS to find the longest increasing path starting from that cell.
    - During the DFS, check the neighbors (up, down, left, right). If the neighbor has a larger value, move to that cell and continue the DFS.
    - Use a memoization table dp where dp[i][j] stores the result of the longest increasing path starting from cell (i, j).
2. Memoization:
    - If the result for a cell is already computed, return the stored value to avoid redundant DFS calls.
3. Edge Cases:
    - If the matrix is empty, return 0.
    - If all elements are the same, the longest path will be 1 (no increase).

### 4. The Maze
To solve the problem of finding the shortest path in a maze represented as a 2D grid, use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is ideal for this type of problem because it explores all possible paths in layers and guarantees that the first time a destination is reached, it is via the shortest path.

#### Steps
1. Initialize a queue and add the starting point with 0 steps.
2. Initialize a visited array to keep track of the cells that have already been visited.
3. Perform BFS, exploring the 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right).
4. If you reach the destination, return the number of steps taken.
5. If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, return -1.

### 5. Clone Graph
To clone a connected undirected graph, traverse the original graph and make a deep copy of every node and its edges. A common approach to this problem is using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

#### Steps
1. If the node has already been visited, return its clone.
2. If the node hasn't been visited, create a clone and recursively clone its neighbors.
