Graph Traversal and Pathfinding Problems.

Samples included are;
1. <b>Number of Islands</b>: Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
2. <b>Shortest Path in Binary Matrix</b>: Given an n x n binary matrix, find the length of the shortest clear path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
3. <b>Longest Path in a Matrix</b>: Given an m x n matrix of integers, find the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.


### 1. Number of Islands
The problem of counting the number of islands in a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water) can be solved using graph traversal techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each island is a group of connected '1's (vertically or horizontally connected).

1. Time complexity: <b>ùëÇ(n * m)</b>
2. Space complexity: <b>ùëÇ(n * m)</b>

#### Steps
1. Traverse the grid, cell by cell.
2. When you find a '1', it means you have encountered an unvisited part of an island.
3. Use DFS to mark all the connected '1's as visited by changing them to '0' or using a separate visited array.
4. Increment the island count and continue searching for more unvisited '1's.
5. Repeat until the entire grid is traversed.

### 2. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
The "Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix" problem can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS), as BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

#### Steps
1. Use BFS to explore the shortest path level by level, starting from the top-left corner (0, 0).
2. Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
3. For each cell, check its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals).
4. If you reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1), return the current path length.
5. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the bottom-right, return -1 (no valid path exists).

### 3. Longest Path in a Matrix
The problem of finding the Longest Path in a Matrix involves determining the maximum length of a path such that the values in the matrix strictly increase along the path.

#### Steps
1. DFS with Memoization:
    - For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, perform DFS to find the longest increasing path starting from that cell.
    - During the DFS, check the neighbors (up, down, left, right). If the neighbor has a larger value, move to that cell and continue the DFS.
    - Use a memoization table dp where dp[i][j] stores the result of the longest increasing path starting from cell (i, j).
2. Memoization:
    - If the result for a cell is already computed, return the stored value to avoid redundant DFS calls.
3. Edge Cases:
    - If the matrix is empty, return 0.
    - If all elements are the same, the longest path will be 1 (no increase).
