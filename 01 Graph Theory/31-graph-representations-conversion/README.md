## Converting between different graph representations
Converting between different graph representations. Transform between Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, and Edge List representations.

### Definitions
1. <b>Adjacency Matrix</b>: A 2D matrix where the element at row i and column j is 1 (or the edge weight) if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, otherwise 0.
2. <b>Adjacency List</b>: A list of lists where the i-th list contains all the neighbors of vertex i.
3. <b>Edge List</b>: A list of tuples where each tuple represents an edge (u, v) or (u, v, weight).

### Conversions
1. <b>Adjacency Matrix to Adjacency List</b>
