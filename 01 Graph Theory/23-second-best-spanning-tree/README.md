## Second Best Spanning Tree
To find the second-best spanning tree (SBST) of a graph, it is required to identify a spanning tree with a total edge weight that is the smallest possible while being strictly greater than the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST). Steps are explained below.</br>

1. Time complexity: <b>ùëÇ(V E log V)</b>
2. Space complexity: <b>ùëÇ(V E)</b></br>


### Steps
1. Compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
   - Use algorithms like Kruskal's or Prim's to find the MST of the given graph.
2. Identify Candidate Trees:
   - Consider removing each edge in the MST one at a time. For each removal, find an alternative edge that can be added to form a new spanning tree.
   - Calculate the weight of the new tree formed by replacing the removed edge with an alternative edge.
3. Select the Second Best Tree:
   - Among all the candidate trees generated by the above step, select the one with the smallest weight that is greater than the weight of the original MST.

### Uses
The second-best spanning tree (SBST) enhances network reliability and fault tolerance by providing an alternative route in case the primary spanning tree fails. It is useful in network design, optimization problems, and infrastructure planning, ensuring continuous operation and efficient resource allocation even in the event of disruptions.
