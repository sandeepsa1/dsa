## Longest path in an unweighted graph
To find the longest path in an unweighted graph, depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization can be used.</br>

1. Time complexity: <b>ùëÇ(V + E)</b>
2. Space complexity: <b>ùëÇ(V<sup>2</sup>)</b></br>


### How this works
1. The 'dfs' function performs a depth-first search from the current node to the end node.
2. It uses a memoization dictionary 'memo' to store the longest path and its length starting from each node to the end node.
3. If the current node is the end node, it returns a path with length 0 and the end node itself.
4. If the longest path from a node is already computed and stored in 'memo', it returns the cached result.
5. Otherwise, it explores all neighbors of the current node, recursively calling 'dfs' and updating the longest path found.

### Uses
Finding the longest path in a graph is essential in various fields, such as project scheduling, where it helps identify the critical path in a project timeline. It is also used in network optimization to determine the maximum delay path in communication networks, ensuring reliability and robustness in data transmission.
