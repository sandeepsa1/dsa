## Graph Optimization and Network Flow
Algorithms on Graph Optimization and Network Flow.

Samples included are;
1. <b>Network Delay Time</b>: There are N network nodes, labeled 1 to N. You are given a list of times where times[i] = (u, v, w) means the time it takes for a signal to travel from node u to node v is w seconds. Compute the time it takes for all nodes to receive a signal from a given start node.
2. <b>Critical Connections in a Network</b>: Given a network of n nodes and n-1 edges, find all critical connections (bridges) in the network.



### 1. Network Delay Time
This problem is known as the "Network Delay Time" problem and can be solved using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes in a directed graph with weighted edges.

#### Steps
1. Graph Representation:
    - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each entry in the adjacency list stores the destination node and the travel time as a tuple.
2. Shortest Path Algorithm:
    - Apply Dijkstra's Algorithm since it efficiently finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.
    - Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) to always expand the shortest known path first.
3. Edge Cases:
    - If any node is unreachable, return -1.
    - If all nodes are reachable, return the maximum time it takes to reach any node.


### 2. Critical Connections in a Network
This problem is about finding critical connections (also known as bridges) in an undirected graph. A bridge in a graph is an edge that, if removed, would increase the number of connected components, effectively disconnecting the graph.

#### Steps
The most efficient way to find all the bridges in a graph is by using Tarjan's Algorithm. This algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) and keeps track of discovery and low-link values to identify bridges.
