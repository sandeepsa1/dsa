## Graph Optimization and Network Flow
Algorithms on Graph Optimization and Network Flow.

Samples included are;
1. <b>Network Delay Time</b>: There are N network nodes, labeled 1 to N. You are given a list of times where times[i] = (u, v, w) means the time it takes for a signal to travel from node u to node v is w seconds. Compute the time it takes for all nodes to receive a signal from a given start node.



### 1. Network Delay Time
This problem is known as the "Network Delay Time" problem and can be solved using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes in a directed graph with weighted edges.

#### Steps
1. Graph Representation:
    - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each entry in the adjacency list stores the destination node and the travel time as a tuple.
2. Shortest Path Algorithm:
    - Apply Dijkstra's Algorithm since it efficiently finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.
    - Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) to always expand the shortest known path first.
3. Edge Cases:
    - If any node is unreachable, return -1.
    - If all nodes are reachable, return the maximum time it takes to reach any node.
